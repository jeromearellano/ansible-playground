# config file for ansible -- https://ansible.com/
# ===============================================

# nearly all parameters can be overridden in ansible-playbook
# or with command line flags. ansible will read ANSIBLE_CONFIG,
# ansible.cfg in the current working directory, .ansible.cfg in
# the home directory or /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, whichever it
# finds first

# the remote system.

# implicit - gather by default, turn off with gather_facts: False
# explicit - do not gather by default, must say gather_facts: True

# by default gathering retrieves all facts subsets

# virtual - gather min and virtual facts
# facter - import facts from facter
# ohai - import facts from ohai

# You can negate them using ! (ex: !hardware,!facter,!ohai)
# A minimal set of facts is always gathered.
